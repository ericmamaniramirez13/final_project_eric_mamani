# My projest has the following sorting algorithms:
- 1. Selection Sort. O($n^2$)
- 2. Bubble Sort. O($n^2$)
- 3. Insertion Sort. O($n^2$)
- 4. Merge Sort. O($log_2(n)$)
- 5. Quick Sort.O($nlog_2(n)$)
- 6. Heap Sort. O($nlog_2(n)$)

This project helps us visualize how these sorting algorithm work.

Future Update:
I plan on adding data structures like D'jkastra's algorithm, which is a finder of the shortest path, having a starting point, and a goal point, among all the possible paths I want the shortest one.
