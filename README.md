# My projest has the following sorting algorithms:
- 1. Selection Sort. O(n^2)
- - In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(nÂ²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
- 2. Bubble Sort. O(n^2)
- - Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed.
- 3. Insertion Sort. O(n^2)
- - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparisons. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
- 4. Merge Sort. O(log_2(n))
- - In computer science, merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output
- 5. Quick Sort.O(nlog_2(n))
- - Quicksort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm
- 6. Heap Sort. O(nlog_2(n))
- - In computer science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort, heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region

This project helps us visualize how these sorting algorithm work.

Future Update:
I plan on adding data structures like D'jkastra's algorithm, which is a finder of the shortest path, having a starting point, and a goal point, among all the possible paths I want the shortest one.
